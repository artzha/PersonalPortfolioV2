		"desc": "During my first year as an avionics member on MASA, U of M's student rocketry team, I researched and designed a 8 layer PCB capable of monitoring and actively balancing rocket fuel tank pressures with rapid pressure fluctuations. My STM32 based PCB supports sensor circuitry and control for brushed and brushless motors, valves, pressure transducers, thermocouples, and full duplex RS-422 communications. I am currently integrating PID control algorithms and firmware libraries in C for interfacing with components on the PCB, like ADCs and flash memory.",

I designed this project for use in fault tolerant navigation systems, such as spacecraft and automobile transporation. This project implements work from multiple research papers, using techniques like quarternion sensor fusion, low cost time synchronization, and fault resolution tactics inspired by Byzantine Generals.",

This BMS connects with up to 6 cells, uses SPI communications written in C to efficiently communicate with its peripherals, and is daisy chainable with up to 32 other battery management pcbs. The intended purpose for this pcb is to monitor roughly 100 lithium ion battery cells during our bike's races next season.",

I used an Arduino Uno and various sensors (GPS, IMU, temperature) to collect the data on the motorcycle and clean it using sensor fusion algorithms before saving it to an sd card. This data collected can be viewed on the telemetry dashboard (shown above). The dashboard supports a playback feature that allows users to view how the data changes by the second.",
